Applied Data & Technology: a team of technologists, data scientists, engineers, software engineers, service designers and researchers.Places become more populated, responding to emergent agendas around net zero, regional economic growth, post-pandemic recovery and resilience there is a need to make use of data for new technological innovations.

Key Responsibilities

Line manage the Data Science and Software Engineering Team, caring for team culture, establishing best practise and supporting the team to develop as a group stronger than the sum of its parts
Use your expertise to provide hands-on insight, technical support and input into project work – taking a technical leadership role on projects and acting as decision making support for the team on projects
Develop and grow the capacity, skills and service offering of the Data Science and Software Engineering Team to match the needs of our project pipeline
Develop, embed and promote the tools and processes the Data Science and Software Engineering Team use to deliver their work effectively and sustainably
Help develop and scope new project opportunities to ensure quality, strategic fit and feasibility
Have oversight across projects where the Data Science and Software Engineering Team has a role, and provide regular updates on these
Ensure the delivery of high-quality work, understanding project requirements, coordinating to make sure the right data science expertise is identified, and where necessary, taking the project in the right direction. It is anticipated that at least 50% of the candidates’ time will be allocated to projects.
Work to align the Data Science and Software Engineering team’s work and strategy, spotting opportunities for adding new value across teams focused on housing, transport and our other "place" domains
Be a thought leader in technology and data, playing a driving role in formulating our data and technology vision on current place-based issues. We are very keen on problem-first, collaborative approaches and putting ethics at the heart of our work in the team.
