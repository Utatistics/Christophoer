Up to £120,000
London

(Mid-Level to Principal) Data Scientist for deep-tech company of scientists and engineers, developing machine learning applications to massively accelerate physics simulations and enable a new frontier of optimisation opportunities in design and engineering.

They help customers radically improve their concepts and designs, transform their engineering processes and drive operational product performance in industries including Space, Aerospace, Medical Devices, Additive Manufacturing, Electric Vehicles, Motorsport, and Renewables.

They have a positive societal impact with carbon emissions reductions and biotech developments. They are rapidly growing and profitable company but prefer to fly under the radar to protect our customers’ confidentiality.

What you will do:
Work closely with our simulation engineers, machine learning engineers and customers to develop an understanding of the physics and engineering challenges we are solving
Build innovative models to predict the behaviour of physical systems leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques
Own the delivery of data science workstreams, potentially while mentoring more junior colleagues
Design, build and test data pipelines for machine learning that are reliable, scalable and easily deployable
Discuss the results and implications of your work with your colleagues and our customers
Contribute to our internal R&D and product work

What you bring to the table:
Enthusiasm about using machine learning for science and engineering
Degree in computer science, machine learning, applied statistics, mathematics, physics, engineering or a related field
Experience in a data-driven role, with exposure to: o Building machine learning models and pipelines in Python, using common libraries and frameworks (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Airflow), potentially including deep-learning applications
Software engineering concepts and best practices for collaborative programming (e.g., versioning, testing, deployment) o Working in a cloud environment with one of the major cloud providers o (Appreciated, but not a prerequisite) Simulations for FEA/CFD
Ability to scope and effectively deliver projects
Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to analyse issues, identify causes, and recommend solutions quickly
Excellent collaboration and communication skills - with teams and customers alike
(For more experienced candidates) Passion and track record of managing, mentoring and coaching more junior colleagues
