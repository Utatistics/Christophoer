About Us

We‚Äôre here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque.

We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves.

We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.

About Our Monzo Flex Team

We're looking for a Product Data Scientist excited to help us revolutionise the way people manage their finances. A key part of this role is product development our recently launched Monzo Flex, a product that gives customers a better way to pay later. You‚Äôll help us understand and improve the user experience for a new product, help drive growth (we have over five million current account customers), and how we consider cross product dynamics across the range of borrowing products.

At Monzo, we're building a bank that is fair, transparent and a delight to use. We‚Äôre growing extremely fast and have over five million customers in the UK. We‚Äôve built a product that people love and more than 80% of our growth comes from word of mouth and referrals.

Our Product Analytics team's mission is to Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company - and want to embed this into Monzo Flex, using powerful, real-time analytics to drive how we think about product development, growth hacking, and ongoing customer engagement.

Your day-to-day
Work within a Product squad within the Borrowing Collective, collaborating closely with designers, PMs, and engineers to develop the testing and product roadmap for Monzo Flex.
Actively explore uptake and engagement of Monzo Flex and our other borrowing products, to make sure we can offer the right product and features to our customers
Be the expert on running simple and more complex experiments so that we can reliably measure the impact of changes we make to our borrowing products
Scale your knowledge and impact across data in borrowing by sharing your knowledge and working with others on projects and experiments
Find enjoyment in contributing to data across Monzo by sharing your insights, contributing to our core data pipelines and proactively spotting opportunities for applications of your work in other areas of the business
