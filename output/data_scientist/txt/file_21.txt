twentyAI are partnering with a leading retailer with a large online grocery platform in the UK. The business is currently going through a large multi-year technology transformation programme which will see all of its legacy systems migrated to the cloud (Azure) and the build out of a data lake. As part of that, the business is looking to hire data scientists who can solve business problems and improve operations through advanced analytics and machine learning.

The Role

A lot of work is currently underway with a healthy pipeline of projects underpinned by POCs looking at promotions/sales, churn, clustering etc. You will be able to take lead on some of the projects whilst working hands-on on the development and implementation of machine learning solutions. Moreover, the implementation of a data lake will make the entirety of the data including revenue data, data from stalls, in-app purchase data, etc available to the data science team to explore with ease. This will provide an incredible opportunity for data science and analytics to start underpinning key decision making in order to create business value. You will be tasked with problem identification of high value opportunities, and designing strategic approaches for value delivery.

Background

The ideal individual will have a complete set of data science skills including advanced machine learning, data engineering, data visualisation and a strong commercial analytics skills set. You will have experience conducting machine learning in a business environment. No specific industry requirements but retail could be considered a plus. You will be able to articulate complex Data Science concepts in simple terms to stakeholders across the business and, most importantly, would be passionate about solving business problems through data.

Role is based in the Midlands with expectation of visiting the office once a fortnight.
