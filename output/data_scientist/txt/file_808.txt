Programme overview

The Centre for Doctoral Training in Computational Statistics and Data Science (Compass) is a four-year PhD training programme that addresses the pressing need, in the UK and internationally, for doctoral graduates who are able to combine fluency in both statistical and computational methods. This programme links modern computational statistics to real world problems in science and society.

Compass is hosted by the Institute for Statistical Science in the School of Mathematics and integrated with internal partners from across the University and external partners from industry and government. Our team of PhD supervisors incorporates world-leading statisticians and data scientists, and experts from the Faculties of Health Sciences, Engineering, Social Sciences and Law and Life Sciences.

Compass involves a specially designed taught first year that is delivered through lectures, workshops, laboratories and guided self-study, and includes peer-supported learning and group work. PhD projects and supervisors are matched to students during the first nine months and mini project proposals are developed through the second semester of the first year, before full-time research starts in October of your second year.

PhD topics range from theory and methodology of statistics and data science, to collaborative interdisciplinary projects with experimental scientists, government agencies or industry. We provide excellent facilities at the heart of the University campus in central Bristol, one of the most creative and liveable European cities.

We welcome applications from all members of our community and are particularly encouraging those from diverse groups, such as members of the LGBT+ and BAME communities, to join us.
