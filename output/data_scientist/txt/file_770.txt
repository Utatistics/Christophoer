About Us

We‚Äôre here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque.

We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves.

We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.

About Our Financial Crime Team

We're excited to be looking for a Senior Data Scientist in Financial Crime to help build the bank of the future. You'll have the opportunity to work as a part of the Financial Crime Data Science team and play a critical role in Monzo‚Äôs mission to make money work for everyone.

What you‚Äôll be working on

As a Data Scientist, you‚Äôll be working in an ever changing environment where we are building and iterating on our financial crime defence capabilities to ensure we keep Monzo and our customers safe. As a financial crime team we have a large impact on Monzo‚Äôs bottom line as fraud and scams are usually some of the largest cost line items in a bank's P&L. In addition, we have a great influence on the overall customer experience and it‚Äôs our duty to keep them safe. Most of the work we do results in directly measurable customer or company benefit which is incredibly satisfying.

Our Data Scientists don‚Äôt have a permanent assignment to a problem space and might rotate into different financial crime areas after some time. The major problem spaces that we are working in are: fraud prevention, transaction monitoring for different types of suspicious activity, customer risk assessment and operational tooling to name the biggest ones. At the moment we are about 21 people in financial crime data, including Analytics Engineers, Data Analysts, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists.

As part of your job you‚Äôll work closely with product managers, engineers, designers and researchers in an agile product environment. You‚Äôll champion the use of data, bring ideas to life through rigorous experimentation and A/B testing. You‚Äôll help us get the most out of large volumes of data stored on a modern cloud native data platform and with spotting opportunities to make each area of financial crime work even better for our users and for Monzo.

Our culture is open and focused on collaboration between different functions and individuals. It is fast paced and innovative where we try to push the boundaries of the current financial industry best practices. We put a lot of emphasis on feedback (up, side and downwards) and personal growth and development.

Your day-to-day
Develop and drive data solutions that improve our ability to fight financial crime and keep customers safe
Conduct deep dives into various Fincrime systems for fraud detection, transaction monitoring and customer risk to identify key business opportunities

Build robust data models, reports and visualisations downstream of backend services (mostly in BigQuery SQL) that support internal management information as well as governance and regulatory reporting

The Interview Process:

Our Interview Process Involves Three Main Stages
