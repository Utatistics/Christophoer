Senior Data Scientist / Data Scientist - F1 Motorsport

Location: Oxfordshire (four days in the office, one day working from home).

Package: £50-70k for mid-level Data Scientist, £70-90k for Senior Data Scientist + Championship bonus scheme, bike-to-work scheme (worth up to £3k), healthcare & life assurance options, and pension contribution (5% matched).

_______________________________________________________________

2.62 seconds. The time it takes to service an entire F1 racing car at the pit stop.

2 weeks. The time you have as a Data Scientist to optimise that racing car's performance.

Your data could make or break lap time for one of the world's leading F1 teams.

A lap time that over 500 million people will see at the most-watched annual sporting series in the world.

As a Data Scientist, you'll provide data services to the rest of the company to continuously improve their F1 racing car design and performance.

You'll work in an incredibly high-profile, competitive environment where you collaborate closely with your teammates in friendly and innovative surroundings. Ideas are turned around in mere minutes or hours, from proposal - to concept - to result.

And in this ever-changing landscape, you'll do whatever it takes to find the solution and hit the deadline.

Because ultimately, you're all working towards the same goal: to improve the F1 racing car's performance.

To drive you to hit those deadlines, you'll benefit from:

Variety of work - every day is different, with projects determined by the needs of upcoming tests and races, and turnaround is rapid.

High impact - you'll have the unique opportunity to quickly see the impact of your work in as little as two weeks.

A collaborative culture - join a fast-paced, harmonised and rewarding culture where everyone has one clear goal, and the passion for what they do is infectious.

Ownership and equipment - you'll have control of your data, from transfer to access, plus the software and hardware you need to enable you to turn ideas into production.

Rare opportunity - to work in one of the world's most prestigious and high-profile industries, where succeeding in your role could seriously boost your career.

Could you handle the speed?

What's the Role?

You'll join a tight community of 120 colleagues, where your team has one collective goal: to maximise downforce, minimise drag and improve the racing car's performance.

Reporting to the Head of Aerodynamic Technology, you’ll have access to data from state-of-the-art aerodynamic testing environments, across wind tunnel, computational fluid dynamics and track – with all the software and hardware you need to do the job.

Your role will primarily involve:

Developing systems for automated data capture and analysis.

Mathematical optimisation of trajectories and data capture strategies to optimise the operating point with the Quality/Time/Coverage triangle.

Developing existing methodologies for processing force/moment, pressure and flow field data sources.

Refining measurement technologies.

Specifying and implementing algorithms (machine learning & deep learning techniques) to analyse captured data and provide performance information to aerodynamicists.

Mining historical data to provide new insights to assist in defining development strategies for tools and aero surfaces.

Develop interoperable APIs for data exchange.

Develop, refine and apply data analysis techniques across the domains to provide aerodynamicists with actionable information.

Building the next generation tools across the department to improve integration and standardisation.

Enabling 65 internal end-users to have more self-help with their expert tools.

What You'll Add

You won't be afraid to try new things or ask for help when you don't know the answer - leading with a flexible and experimental approach is key to success in this role.

You'll be naturally inquisitive and keen to try out different ideas for testing, problem-solving and using data across various domains.

And you'll add the following skills and experience:

At least two years of industry experience for the mid-level Data Scientist role or five years of experience for the Senior Data Scientist role.

Proactive development of detailed specifications based on business requirements.

Experience with Python and related data science machine-learning libraries (currently working with Matlab, but moving away from using this platform).

Excellent communication skills at both conceptual and technical levels.

Natural problem-solving abilities.

A high degree of attention to detail.

A thorough grounding in modern software development practices (source control, change management, automated testing, release procedures).

Beneficial to have experience working with Microsoft Azure services or related cloud-based platforms.
