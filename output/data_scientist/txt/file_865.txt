About the Role
This role will support the ESRC-GCRF funded Scaling-up Off-grid Sanitation project, which is will study Container Based Sanitation (CBS) systems in Haiti, Peru, South Africa and Kenya. This role will focus specifically on analysing smartphone survey data from users and non-users of Container Based Sanitation. The smartphone surveys will seek to understand multiple aspects of the usersâ€™ experiences of sanitation services, including their mental well-being. As data is collected daily a large volume will be generated an appropriate statistical tools will need to be applied. As the project finishes, this role will also be involved in preparing a proposal for follow-on work.

About You
You will have a PhD with a major statistical analysis component and an interest in international development or infrastructure planning. You should be willing to learn about the sanitation sector, but previous experience is not required. Your previous research experience should be evidenced by a peer-reviewed publication track record. You will have experience in writing research proposals.
