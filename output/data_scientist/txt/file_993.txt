Applications for our Summer 2023 intake will open in October 2022 but you can register your interest early here.

Are you interested in learning and working in the world of data with its application into media and marketing? Does the world of innovative digital marketing grab your attention? Would you like to experience working at a fast-growing, independently owned agency based in central London just off Oxford Circus?

If the answer to all the above is ‘YES!’ then look no further than Medialab.

We’re a rapidly growing team which means there is lots of scope for you to develop your skills during your placement year. We’re also known as market-leaders in our field, and we have a very happy client base which we’re proud of, including major brands such as Laithwaite’s Wine and SunLife as well as several charities, including The National Trust, Guide Dogs Association for the Blind, Alzheimer’s Society and Mind.

We are looking for inquisitive, articulate, numerate, and above all eager placement students to support the wider team in improving campaign performance and the understanding of consumer behaviour gained through the analysis of client data.

Our business is built around our unique marketing intelligence platform Apollo – a technology that turns data into insights we can act on. Importantly, this tool centralises and automates the data collection process, meaning our modelling team can focus on developing the story and strategy to be recommended to clients, rather than data processing typically associated with these roles.

The team are young, fun and not afraid of hard-work and over-delivering on client expectations – and you’ll need to be part of this ethos.
