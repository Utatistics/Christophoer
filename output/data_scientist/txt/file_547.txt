Data Scientist - Sustainable Energy

How will you use time series modelling to support critical decision making within the renewable energy space?

As a Data Scientist you will have the chance to work in a team who are disrupting the energy space, and maximising the value of grid-scale battery storage.

They are looking for a Data Scientist who has an interest in utilising Probabilistic and Bayesian modelling to help forecast energy price fluctuations, to enable their energy traders to make safer investment decisions.


Your responsibilities will include:
Modelling co-located solar + storage sites, to help design optimal commercial arrangements
Modelling market signals to design novel structures to manage risks for battery owners
Bringing an experimental mindset, prototyping and developing with the right model for the job.


They offer long term development, and training budgets to allow you to continue growing in the role, along with further, competitive, financial benefits.

If you want to have serious impact within the Data Science space, this is the role for you!

The team are based in Oxford, and looking for someone to visit the office once per week.
