Job Description

The Department of Twin Research & Genetic Epidemiology holds 30 years of data gathered from various sources on over 14,000 participants of its TwinsUK cohort. It is one of the most deeply characterised adult twin cohorts in the world, providing a rich platform for scientists to research health and ageing longitudinally.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TwinsUK joined the Government funded National Core Studies (NCS) programme and became an active member of the UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC). As a result, TwinsUK is engaging in a national effort to enable data linkage to study participants’ official health, educational and environmental records.

As part of a wider effort, TwinsUK is also applying for access to the study participants’ health, educational and environmental records so that they can be linked to the vast collection of longitudinal omic and phenotypic data amassed in the past 30 years, leading to a huge and centralised resource of health research data.

They will be responsible for creating automated or semi-automated tools to process these linked data and making them available to approved, bona-fide researchers within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) and in segregated project spaces.

The postholder will be part of a highly collaborative and inclusive team, working under the supervision of the Data Manager. Proficiency in the use of programming tools for data and database manipulation is essential. The applicant will provide high quality general operations coordination & support to the Data team, the PIs and wider professional services team in the Department and School.

Applicants will have a strong interest & knowledge of clinical research data, a proactive attitude and excellent organisational & planning skills.
