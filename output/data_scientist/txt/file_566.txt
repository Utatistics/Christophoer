Hybrid Intelligence, a Capgemini Engineering team, is looking for a talented senior data scientist/software developer with a background in science, mathematics or engineering to join us. You will have the opportunity to use a range of skills to create, develop and deliver solutions that truly make a difference in the world.
You will help our clients solve a variety of science and engineering problems. Projects can span a range of activities and your responsibilities will include:

Designing and developing custom software solutions or tools.
Building strong relationships, communicating and collaborating with clients and colleagues.
Our projects are exciting and rewarding and provide plenty of opportunities to learn and develop. They can be based either on client sites or in our offices, so you will be expected to undertake regular travel, usually no more than one hour from your base office.

Requirements
BSc, MSc or PhD in science, mathematics or engineering. This is important in order to speak the same language as our clients and understand their industry-related challenges.

Programming skills in Python and experience in some of our other core technologies, for example: .Net Core, C#, Javascript, React, Azure/AWS platform services, Docker/Kubernetes to name a few.

Excellent interpersonal skills and the ability to explain complex concepts to clients and colleagues from all backgrounds.
The eagerness and capacity to quickly learn new domains and technologies.
Career Development and Training
We offer excellent prospects for your future. While we do offer traditional career paths, most staff end up shaping their own based on their aspirations, the skills they have developed and the projects they have worked on. As your career progresses, you will be able to contribute to projects in a variety of roles, from Data Scientist and Software Developer to Business Analyst and Project Manager, or any combination of these. We take personal development seriously and all staff receive an annual training allowance of 150 hours, which can be used to learn new technical and soft skills, often leading to recognised professional qualifications.
