Do you have a passion for using your data science skills for public good? Are you excited about innovation, and the opportunity to explore tools, techniques, and data sources to solve interesting challenges with data? Do you thrive in a multi-disciplinary, collaborative environment? Are you curious about the world, and looking for ways to improve it using data? If so, this may be the job for you!

We are looking for skilled and enthusiastic data scientists to join our new Data Science and Innovation Team. We’re currently recruiting two advanced data scientists and one principal data scientist, reporting to the Head of Data Science.

If you’d like to discuss the job further, please contact Louisa Nolan, Head of Data Science,louisa.nolan@wales.nhs.uk.

You’ll lead multi-disciplinary, cross-organisational Agile teams to exploit novel and traditional data sources to support Public Health Wales in its mission to protect and improve the health and well-being and reduce health inequalities for the people of Wales.

You’ll lead the scoping, design and delivery of a variety of data science and analytical projects. You’ll be adept at bringing together stakeholders, to understand their needs, and interpret these to deliver data products. And you’ll have good project management skills, to deliver collaborative, timely products with impact.

We know that data scientists aren’t unicorns, so, in addition to strong R and / or Python skills, you’ll have experience in at least one, but probably not all of: natural language processing, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, building dashboards and visualisations, building reproducible analytical pipelines. And you’ll have some data management and engineering skills as well, perhaps manipulation and analysis of complex, high volume, high dimensionality data; relational and non-relational databases; SQL / NoSQL databases; cloud storage and data management; data linkage; or experience with unstructured data.

You’ll be responsible for ensuring your team writes and publishes good quality code, adhering to the principles of good practice.
