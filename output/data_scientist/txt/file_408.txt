Due to the rapid growth of the data and analytical capabilities within the organisation, an exciting position has opened up for a Data Scientist in the Analytics team to strengthen and advance the use of data and insight across Knight Frank’s internal business functions and external client base.

Supported by the wider Analytics team you will design and lead analysis on datasets relating to residential and commercial property markets and global wealth drawing together spatial and non-spatial data on market performance, demographics and other phenomena pertinent to the study of real estate. You will be actively encouraged to look at new ways to analyse and visualise data, and you will bring the vision, spontaneity and confidence to contribute ideas that gain traction with our clients and wider market commentators.

The role will require someone who has a very strong data modelling background, an academic background is advantageous but not essential.
