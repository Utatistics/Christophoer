What is Sylvera anyway? ‍👩‍👨🌳

Sylvera is scaling carbon markets with software. We do this by applying advanced machine learning techniques to satellite data to quantify with unprecedented accuracy the amount of carbon stored in landscapes - and then we visualise that data to our customers.

We believe the transparency Sylvera provides will enable carbon markets to have a more positive impact on the world in a shorter space of time. This will be critical in keeping the planet under 2C of warming and provide huge wider benefits to nature and society.

Founded just 2 years ago, Sylvera has now scaled to over 100 employees across the world and has raised over $30m from leading VCs like Index Ventures and Insight Partners. We’ve also collaborated with leading institutions - University College London and UCLA.

We're on a super steep trajectory over the next couple of years - we want incredible people that are as passionate as we are about the mission and want to build an amazing organisation with us to achieve it.

What will I be doing? ‍‍👩‍💻👨‍💻

Having found early product-market fit in a nascent, rapidly growing space, we’re now scaling our Machine Learning team at pace. We’re looking for mission-driven, Machine Learning Engineer to join our Machine Learning function and bring an understanding of intergovernmental forestry policy to compliment the existing team.

Contributing to the development of remote sensing and machine learning pipelines, tools and models for evaluating forest MRV activities
Collaborate with various Sylvera teams in defining and developing methodological approaches to be used in forest monitoring
Deliver critical assessment and expert review of proposed state-of-the-art approaches to carbon accounting, data, and analysis in line with the latest science and policy developments (e.g., academic research, GFOI, UNFCCC/IPCC, carbon accreditation standards, other reporting frameworks)
Build the capacities of Sylvera staff to replicate/apply the methods used

Strong working knowledge of remote sensing data e.g. Optical, SAR, LIDAR
Strong working knowledge of Python and geospatial libraries and packages i.e. GDAL, rasterio, Earth Engine, XArray, QGIS
Foundation in statistics (and/or forest mensuration)
Familiarity with forest sampling techniques, allometry, baseline calculations, etc is a plus
Understanding of use of field data, including permanent plots, forest mensuration, allometric models, forest inventory techniques
Experience with forest carbon projects and carbon offset protocols is a plus
Familiarity with machine learning methods specially applied to remote sensing data
Breadth of coverage and capable of making informed decisions about choice of tools, models and approaches
Familiarity and understanding of the technical aspects of carbon accounting frameworks and standards/guidelines: UNFCCC, IPCC 2006 guidelines, GFOI methodological guidance, FCPF methodological framework, ART-TREES, Gold Standard, Verra-VCS, CORSIA, etc
Relevant experience in elaboration and delivery of carbon estimates for mitigation action design (e.g., REDD+ projects and programs) and implementation at either national, subnational or project scales
Experience in forest carbon accounting related work streams for national and/or project level estimates
Cares deeply about the climate and ecosystems of the earth
Is a self-starter who thrives in constantly evolving environments, ideally with early-stage experience
